***

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack exploits a weakness in the handling of RST\_STREAM frames within the HTTP/2 protocol. By sending a large number of these frames rapidly, an attacker can overwhelm a server, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

***

### Diagnosing Vulnerability

To check if a server uses HTTP/2, you can use the following curl command:

```sh
curl -sl https://example.com -o/dev/null -w '%{http_version}\n'
```

If the output is `2`, the server may be vulnerable.

***

There are very few servers running HTTP/2. So, even if a vulnerability scanner flags this CVE, don't panic. First, check if your server is actually affected by using the `curl` command or by reviewing your server configuration.

If the command returns `1.1` or `1`, your server is not vulnerable. If it returns `2`, then you need to consider mitigation measures for HTTP/2.
