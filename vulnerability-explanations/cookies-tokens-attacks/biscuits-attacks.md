## Introduction üç™

Biscuits are a type of bearer token that offer offline attenuation and decentralized verification. They are designed to be small and efficient, making them suitable for storage in HTTP cookies. However, like any security mechanism, Biscuits are not immune to attacks.

To sum up, Biscuit provides tools to build a complete, cross platform authorization system:

* an authorization token, verified by public key cryptography, that supports offline attenuation
* a logic language based on Datalog to write authorization policies
* a server side library, available for multiple languages, to write authorizers in your applications
* a command line application to create, attenuate, inspect and authorize tokens
* WebAssembly components to create, attenuate, inspect and authorize tokens, as well as to write and debug authorization policies

## Example
